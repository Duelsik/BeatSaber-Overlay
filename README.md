## Requirements
First, you will need a plugin for Beat Saber that will give the information that the overlay needs
- #### [HTTPStatus Plugin](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status/releases) (recommanded for now)
- #### [DataPuller Plugin](https://github.com/kOFReadie/BSDataPuller/releases)

Secondly, you need a stream software ... it's a bit obvious :>

## Installation

Put your plugin (HTTPStatus OR DataPuller) in your game folder at this address `Beat Saber\Plugins\`

After that, in your stream software add a new source "browser" and add in the "url" field this  `https://overlay.hyldrazolxy.fr/`
and in the size fields, put the resolution in which you will stream, for example `1920*1080`

#### Exemple for OBS

And that's it! You have the Overlay on your stream!

##### You can change the resolution to increase the size of the overlay on your stream, but it was designed for 1920*1080, so in theory there is no need to change
